# Programming-Fundamentals-And-Unit-Testing-September-2024
The course covers fundamental concepts in programming, which form the basis for effective and high-quality training in the professional modules of automated testing. Learners build upon the knowledge gained in the QA Fundamentals (Manual) module and begin to study basic programming techniques, such as writing code at a beginner level (basic coding skills), working with development environments (IDEs), using variables and data, operators and expressions, working with the console (reading input and printing output), using conditional constructs (if, if-else) and loops (for, while, do-while), and component testing. The course will also cover basic programming structures such as arrays and lists. The course effectively prepares students for the upcoming professional modules and the knowledge they will acquire from them to become successful specialists in "automated software testing."
